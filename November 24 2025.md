## Perfectly Spherical Crossfit Rocket Pirate in a Vacuum with a Pulley

Chain: Length = 10 m
Linear Density $\rho$ = 2 kg/m

Break it into infinitesimal pieces & calculate work for each piece.

$$
W = mgh
$$

where,
- $m$ - mass in kg
- $g$ - 9.8 N/kg
- $h$ - height lifted in m.

Parametrize your pieces

Here, 

$$
h(y) = y
$$

$$
W = g\int_{0}^{10} \rho \cdot h(y) \, dy
$$

Integrate it as you would.

## Building Pyramids / Pumping Water into Tanks.

Ice pyramid

$$
\rho = 1000 \text{ kg/m$^3$}
$$

Work needed to lift ice into pyramid shape.

We add up the work needed to lift every infinitesimally thin horizontal slice.
